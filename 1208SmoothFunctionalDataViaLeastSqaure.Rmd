Chp 3, 4, and 5 in Functional Data Analysis by J.O.Ramsay and B.W.Silverman, mainly about how to fit function to data.

## OLE
Consider our assumption that
$$y_{j} = x(t_{j}) + \epsilon_{j},\quad j=1,...,T$$
while $x$ are represented by linear combination of the basis functions
$$x = \boldsymbol{c}' \boldsymbol{\phi}$$
Now we rewrite the equation into matrix forms
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= (x(t_{0}), ..., x(t_{T}))' + \epsilon \\
&= (c' \phi(t_{0}), ..., c' \phi(t_{T}))'
\end{aligned}
$$
